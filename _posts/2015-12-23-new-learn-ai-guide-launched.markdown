As I'm preparing for the podcast launch, many people have asked me if I have a list of good resources they can use to start studying about AI and machine learning. Obviously, if you search Google, you'll get thousands of results but it's sometimes hard to know where to start. 

I put together a guide that is broken into two categories: Everybody and Engineers. Many businesspeople and executives want to know more about AI but aren't looking for technical material. I've highlighted some of the best, non-technical material and provided recommendations about where to start. 

For Engineers, when you start looking at how much information is out there and how quickly things are moving, it's easy to get overwhelmed. So, for the engineering section, I've added some recommendations here too on where to start. It's a good time to be an engineer and the sooner you start learning this stuff, the more opportunities you're going to have. But start soon - it won't take long for others to catch up.

If you come across great material, send it my way and I'll add it to this guide. You can tweet it to me at [@conintellect](http://www.twitter.com/conintellect).
