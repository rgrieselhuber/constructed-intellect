In today's edition, we catch up on the news from over the holidays and include a few helpful reviews from 2015.

<strong>NVIDIA</strong> has posted a great set of tutorials around the [core concepts of machine learning](http://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/deep-learning-nutshell-core-concepts/). Added to the [Learn AI guide](/learning-ai-resources-links-courses/). 

<strong>Future of Life has released a great summary</strong> of the [top AI breakthroughs in 2015](http://futureoflife.org/2015/12/29/the-top-a-i-breakthroughs-of-2015/). This article is nice in the way that it breaks the innovations down into five categories of intelligence: abstracting across environments, intuitive concept understanding, creative abstract thought, dreaming up visions, and dexterous fine motor skills.


<strong<A nice collection of thoughts</strong> from various Deep Learning experts on [what to expect in 2016](https://re-work.co/blog/deep-learning-experts-discuss-the-next-5-years)


<strong>An experiment</strong> in "dreaming up" [new Chinese characters using TensorFlow](http://blog.otoro.net/2015/12/28/recurrent-net-dreams-up-fake-chinese-characters-in-vector-format-with-tensorflow/)

<strong>Larry O'Brien shared some good thoughts</strong> on Neural Nets as (programming assistants)(http://sdtimes.com/code-watch-using-deep-neural-networks-as-programming-assistants/].

<strong>This Week in HPC podcast</strong> talking about [Deep Learning and big acquisitions in 2015](http://www.top500.org/blog/deep-learning-and-big-acquisitions-the-year-in-review-in-hpc/).

<strong>The 19 most important things</strong> that happned in (robotics in 2015)[http://www.techinsider.io/ranked-2015-robot-advancements-2015-12].

<strong>Google is planning</strong> a Whatsapp rival, [focusing on AI as a differentiator](http://stayontheblack.com/2016/01/google-plots-whatsapp-rival-with-artificial-intelligence/). We'll see. So far, Google has yet to impress with most of its social software projects.

<strong>On the other hand</strong>, Google does have a lot of success with big computing projects. Here is the latest news about [Google's new quantum computer](http://gadgets.ndtv.com/science/features/why-googles-new-quantum-computer-could-launch-an-artificial-intelligence-arms-race-782905?site=classic).

<strong<A useful</strong> [evaluation of Deep Learning frameworks](https://github.com/zer0n/deepframeworks/).

<strong>Shivon Zilis</strong> has a useful breakdown and chart of the [current field of AI players](http://www.shivonzilis.com/machineintelligence).
