This speech happened in May of 2015, but if you haven't seen it yet, you should. It is one of the best presentations on recent progress in Artificial General Intelligence.

I'll be referring to this video in the upcoming podcast episode, so it will be helpful to have watched it (but not required).

In the video, he makes a very interesting statement:

<blockquote>There are only two fields worth studying: physics and neuroscience.</blockquote>

This is a somewhat hyperbolic but thought-provoking statement, especially if you're a pure materialist with an interest in artificial intelligence.
