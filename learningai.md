<em>A list of resources, links, and courses. Last updated 12/22/2015.</em>

As we look at the resources available to learn about AI, it's helpful to divide them into two categories. 

The first category we will call <strong>Everybody</strong>. The second category is <strong>Engineers</strong>. 

<strong>Everybody</strong> will include both developers and non-technical or business people. These resources are for anybody who has an interest in the general social, philosophical, history, and business impact of AI. 

<strong>Engineers</strong> are programmers, architects, data scientists, and so forth, working in a hands-on or technical leadership role in building AI or machine learning systems.

Until now, we have only heard of and read of the technology side of artificial intelligence. Well, mostly. What we will see become increasingly important over the next couple of years, is the business of artificial intelligence.

If you're a business person and want to stay focused on the non-technical side of things, meaning you aren't actually going to be building these platforms yourself, then you will benefit most from the materials listed under <strong>Everybody</strong> below. 

At some point in the future, I'll add additional resources for kids.

<strong>Engineers</strong> are often tempted to focus on technology at the expense of the business and societal impact, but AI is different. It will have such a profound influence on every area of our lives that, I believe, anyone building AI systems has a responsibility to understand as much as possible about the big picture.

Recommendations are always welcome if you have something to add. Ping me on Twitter at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/{{site.twitter_username}}">@{{site.twitter_username}}</a>.

## AI Resources for Everybody

There is a growing body of material aimed at the non-technical person interested in AI. If you read only one book and take only one online course from this list, I'd go with the Superintelligence book and the Udacity AI course.

### Wikipedia

Often overlooked as a place to start learning, [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org) is a great source of articles and links on some of the most important topics within Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

Here are some of the top ones you should read:

### Books

#### Superintelligence
Author: Nick Bostrom [Link on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom-ebook/dp/B00LOOCGB2/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)

Just released in late 2014, Superintelligence has quickly become the go-to book for business leaders and politicians wishing to learn more about AI and the risks it brings. A must-read.


#### The Age of Spiritual Machines
Author: Ray Kurzweil [Link on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/The-Age-Spiritual-Machines-Intelligence-ebook/dp/B002CIY8JW/ref=pd_sim_351_2?ie=UTF8&dpID=41MLadZgJlL&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL160_SR104%2C160_&refRID=1NEJTK3E46T2ABVQ1ZQF)

One of the earliest internet-era books about technology advancements, Ray Kurzweil paints a picture of the future and how much of it will be completely changed by AI and human / computer interaction. Kurzweil has both fans and detractors, but it's difficult to ignore him.


#### The Singularity is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology
Author: Ray Kurzweil [Link on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Singularity-Near-Humans-Transcend-Biology-ebook/dp/B000QCSA7C/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&me=)

Not centered on AI per se, this book is still worth a read to understand the concept of the Singularity and how AI, advances in biological engineering, and other computing technology will leave a permanent imprint on human history and our next stage of evolution, assuming we make it that far.

#### The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies
Authors: Erik Brynjolfsson, Andrew McAfee [Link on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Second-Machine-Age-Prosperity-Technologies-ebook/dp/B00D97HPQI/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&me=)

Two of the top researchers in AI and machine learning technology examine the societal impact of machine intelligence. A great follow-up read to Bostrom's Superintelligence, as they go deeper into the business changes that are likely to result from learning-based automation on a massive scale.

#### Artificial Intelligence Illuminated 
Author: Ben Coppin [Link on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Illuminated-Ben-Coppin/dp/0763732303)

This is a textbook and gives about the deepest, non-technical overview I've seen about the various technologies and techniques that support modern AI research. This is a good book for Product Managers and other executives to read in order to stay relevant in product discussions with engineers.

### Other Book Lists

There are other book lists that come out on a regular basis, so I'll add them here when I find good examples.

[TechRepublic - Seven AI Books](http://www.techrepublic.com/article/educate-yourself-on-ai-seven-books-to-get-you-started/)


### Courses
[Udacity AI Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs271)

If you're just getting into AI, regardless of whether you are an Engineer or an Everybody, this is the first online course you should take. It's free and has two of the top experts in the field. It's mostly non-technical but covers some of the deeper topics that you'll need to be aware of if you're going to go anywhere in the field.

[Executive Data Science Courses](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/executive-data-science)

This a specialization course that is offered to executives. It's not free but it is very affordable and focuses mostly on Data Science. Data Science isn't exactly AI, of course, but much of the foundational knowledge is the same and it will provide a solid educational background that will help you understand machine learning and intelligence more more quickly.
