<em>A list of resources, links, and courses. Last updated 12/22/2015.</em>

As we look at the resources available to learn about AI, it's helpful to divide them into two categories. 

The first category we will call <strong>Everybody</strong>. The second category is <strong>Engineers</strong>. 

<strong>Everybody</strong> will include both developers and non-technical or business people. These resources are for anybody who has an interest in the general social, philosophical, history, and business impact of AI. 

<strong>Engineers</strong> are programmers, architects, data scientists, and so forth, working in a hands-on or technical leadership role in building AI or machine learning systems.

Until now, we have only heard of and read of the technology side of artificial intelligence. Well, mostly. What we will see become increasingly important over the next couple of years, is the business of artificial intelligence.

If you're a business person and want to stay focused on the non-technical side of things, meaning you aren't actually going to be building these platforms yourself, then you will benefit most from the materials listed under Everybody below. 

At some point in the future, I'll add additional resources for kids.

Engineers are often tempted to focus on technology at the expense of the business and societal impact, but AI is different. It will have such a profound influence on every area of our lives that, I believe, anyone building AI systems has a responsibility to understand as much as possible about the big picture.

Recommendations are always welcome if you have something to add. Ping me on Twitter at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/{{site.twitter_username}}">@{{site.twitter_username}}</a>.

### Wikipedia

Often overlooked as a place to start learning, [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org) is a great source of articles and links on some of the most important topics within Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

Here are some of the top ones you should read:
